// Converting a Function to a Class

class Clock extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
				<h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

/*
The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render <Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks.
