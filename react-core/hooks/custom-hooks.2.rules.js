// Rules of hooks
// There are two core rules of using React hooks that we cannot violate for them to work properly:
// 1. Hooks can only be called at the top of components
// Hooks cannot be in conditionals, loops or nested functions
// 2. Hooks can only be used within function components
// Hooks cannot be in normal JavaScript functions or class components

function checkAuth() {
  // Rule 2 Violated! Hooks cannot be used in normal functions, only components
  React.useEffect(() => {
    getUser();
  }, []);
}

function App() {
  // this is the only validly executed hook in this component
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);

  // Rule 1 violated! Hooks cannot be used within conditionals (or loops)
  if (!user) {
    React.useEffect(() => {
      setUser({ isAuth: false });
      // if you want to conditionally execute an effect, use the
      // dependencies array for useEffect
    }, []);
  }

  checkAuth();

  // Rule 1 violated! Hooks cannot be used in nested functions
  return <div onClick={() => React.useMemo(() => doStuff(), [])}>Our app</div>;
}
